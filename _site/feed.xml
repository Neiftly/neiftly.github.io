&lt;p&gt;I think I need to show that I can consistently code over large periods of time and this is a great project for that
It also gives me a location to show off large projects as videos rather than just uploading a large number of files.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vinayak</name></author><summary type="html">I plan to continue to work on this website for pracitce and to host examples of my work.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Firststeps</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/firststeps.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Firststeps" /><published>2023-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/firststeps</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/firststeps.html">&lt;p&gt;I am making this website to host my portfolio&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided to take the steps neccesary to 
improve my prospects of employment in a field that is seemingly killing itself 
through rapid adaptation of AI. I have nothing against AI and think it is very useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I am following tutorials to make this site so that I can have a portfolio to show off 
my abilities and skills&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vinayak</name></author><summary type="html">I am making this website to host my portfolio</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Moreprogress</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/moreprogress.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Moreprogress" /><published>2023-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2023-10-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/moreprogress</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/10/28/moreprogress.html">&lt;p&gt;I am continuing to learn new things&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am getting back into the groove of software creation and it feels great.
Like stretching a muscle after a long time.
These posts are supposed to be random fruit based things but I might as well put real information in here.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Vinayak</name></author><summary type="html">I am continuing to learn new things</summary></entry></feed>
